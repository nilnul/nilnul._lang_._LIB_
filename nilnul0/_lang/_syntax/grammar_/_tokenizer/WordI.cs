	/// content words. not function words
	/// Words that are not function words are called content words (or open class words or lexical words or autosemantic words): these include nouns, verbs, adjectives, and most adverbs, although some adverbs are function words (e.g., then and why). Dictionaries define the specific meanings of content words, but can only describe the general usages of function words. By contrast, grammars describe the use of function words in detail, but treat lexical words in general terms only.
	/// function words have to be dealt with in phrase(if they are relation)/sentential(if they are multivariate pattern at the sentential level) level.
